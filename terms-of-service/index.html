                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing or using our website or services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If
                    you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use our services.</p>

                <h2>2. Services Provided</h2>
                <p>Repair Asap LLC provides on-site handyman services in NYC and nearby areas. Our services include, but
                    are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Appliance installation and repair</li>
                    <li>Furniture assembly</li>
                    <li>TV mounting and wall hanging</li>
                    <li>Window AC installation and cleaning</li>
                    <li>Plumbing and electrical help</li>
                    <li>General mounting and wall repair</li>
                    <li>Indoor painting and drywall finishing</li>
                    <li>Minor tiling and backsplash</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some services may be performed by trusted subcontractors under our supervision.</p>

                <h2>3. Scheduling &amp; Estimates</h2>
                <p>All service appointments must be scheduled in advance.</p>
                <h3>Remote Estimates (Free)</h3>
                <p>We offer free, non-binding remote estimates based on information, photos, or descriptions you provide
                    via phone, email, or our website.</p>
                <h3>On-Site Visits &amp; Initial Service Fee</h3>
                <p>For an on-site assessment, diagnosis, or to perform pre-agreed very minor tasks, an Initial On-Site
                    Service Fee of <strong>$99 applies</strong>. This fee covers travel to your location and initial
                    time on-site.</p>
                <p>If you approve a larger scope of work quoted during this visit, the $99 Initial On-Site Service Fee
                    will be credited toward the total cost of that approved job.</p>
                <h3>Final Pricing</h3>
                <p>All on-site quotes for work beyond the scope covered by the Initial On-Site Service Fee require your
                    approval before work begins. Final pricing may vary based on actual site conditions and the mutually
                    agreed scope of work. Any changes to scope or price will be discussed and approved by you before
                    additional work is performed.</p>

                <h2>4. Cancellations</h2>
                <p>Please provide at least <strong>24 hours' notice</strong> to cancel or reschedule. Same-day
                    cancellations (less than 24 hours' notice) may be subject to a cancellation fee (typically $50).</p>

                <h2>5. Payment</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Payment is due upon completion of the work unless otherwise agreed in writing.</li>
                    <li>We accept Cash, Zelle, Venmo, Credit/Debit Card, Check, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.</li>
                    <li>No upfront payment is required for standard jobs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Non-payment may result in service suspension and/or legal collection procedures.</p>

                <h2>6. Workmanship &amp; Parts Guarantees</h2>
                <h3>Workmanship Guarantee (1 Year)</h3>
                <p>We provide a 1-year workmanship guarantee on labor performed by our technicians. If anything we
                    installed, assembled, or repaired fails due to our workmanship within that period, we will correct
                    it
                    at no additional charge.</p>
                <p>This guarantee does not cover:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Normal wear and tear</li>
                    <li>Damage resulting from misuse, abuse, accidental damage, or negligence by any party other than
                        Repair Asap LLC</li>
                    <li>Issues arising from underlying system defects or pre-existing conditions not addressed by our
                        service</li>
                    <li>Parts or materials not provided by Repair Asap LLC</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Parts Guarantee (60 Days)</h3>

                    defects for sixty (60) days from the date of service completion.</p>
                <p>This parts guarantee is void if failure or damage is due to any of the exclusions listed under the
                    workmanship guarantee or issues unrelated to the intrinsic quality of the supplied part. Our sole
                    obligation under this parts guarantee will be to replace the defective part we supplied. Labor for
                    replacement may be subject to standard charges if outside the original 1-year workmanship guarantee
                    period.</p>
                <p>To make a claim, contact us promptly with details of the issue and your original service record.</p>
